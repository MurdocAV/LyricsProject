# LyricsProject
I hate wanting lyrics to a song but not having them to follow along. Having it on a different screen is okay but it's not perfect. I want to test a lyric video kind of concept but with an App. MIT licence, not making any profit so I grant all use of this project freely and will use songs without contacting the relevant persons who produced due to obviously not being in contact with them.
